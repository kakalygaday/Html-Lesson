      <h3>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML):</h3>
      <p>Hypertext Markup Language (English Hypertext Markup Language, ks. HTML)
        is the standard text markup language used to create web pages. 
        The latest version of the language is HTML5. 
        HTML cannot be defined as a programming language. Because a program that 
        works on its own cannot be written with HTML codes. Only programs that can work
        through programs that can interpret this language can be written. 
        This is exactly why it cannot be called a programming language. 
        The basic requirement is to simply link different data such as 
        text, images, videos and the pages containing them, in addition 
        to setting the rules necessary for the proper display of these pages 
        by web browser software. Web browsers read, interpret, 
        and transform HTML code into visual, so it's possible that
        the same HTML code will produce different results in different browsers.
        When used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript, visual and dynamic websites can be created through HTML.
        Tim Berners-Lee, who was at CERN, in 1980, believed that there should be a system for 
        CERN researchers to share their information and documents with each other. So he proposed a
        system called ENQUIRE as a prototype. In 1989, the first foundations of the internet-based
        system were laid by the same name Tim Berners Lee. [1] After developing the HTML marku
        language in 1990, he founded the World Wide Web (WWW) system. In this way, HTML,
        which emerged in line with the aim of facilitating information sharing at CERN,
        has formed the main basis of the network, which is indispensable in our lives today.

      <h3>Below is the key difference between HTML and HTML5:</h3>
      <p>
        HTML Doctype declaration is lengthy.	DOCTYPE declaration in HTML5 is simple.
        HTML Character encoding is longer.	HTML5 Character encoding declaration is simple.
        Audio and video are not HTML parts.	Audio and video are HTML5 part.
        It is possible to draw a vector with the help of other technologies like Silverlight, Flash, VML, etc.
        Vector graphics are a part of HTML5, e.g., canvas, SVG.
        It is impossible to get the actual Geolocation of a person browsing any website.	
        JS Geolocation API in HTML5 enables you to identify the location of the user browsing any website.
        HTML offers local storage instead of cookies.	Html5 uses cookies to store data.
        In HTML, it is not possible to draw basic shapes.	In Html5, it is possible to draw basic shapes.
        It allows you to run JavaScript in a browser.	It enables you to run JavaScript code in the background.
        You can use HTML with all old browsers.	You can use HTML5 with all new browsers.
        You can use browser cache as temporary storage.	You can use application (database and web storage) Cache as temporary storage.
        Web Socket is not available.	You can establish full-duplex communication channels with a server using Web Sockets.
        There is no process to handle structurally incorrect HTML codes.	HTML5 supports persistent error handling via
         the improvised error handling process.
